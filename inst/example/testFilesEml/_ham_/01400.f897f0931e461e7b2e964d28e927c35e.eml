Being healthy means eating right and exercising. To keep a healthy balance diet a person should try to eat daily at least a portion of the six major food groups, and exercise at least three times a week to keep the body fit and reduce the chances of poor health. A wholesome diet and lifestyle can help a person live a long healthy life.
             Two of the six major food groups are fruits and vegetables. First, oranges have been found to help fight different types of cancers and other ailments. Researchers found oranges have the highest concentration of antioxidants in all fruits. Antioxidants replenish and minimize the damage to our cells; for example, these cells help us contain a strong immune system to fight infection. They also decrease the aging process our body goes through. Oranges are classified as citrus fruits and it has been discovered that they reduce the risk of mouth, larynx, and stomach cancer by 50%. Broccoli when it is chewed or smashed contains small amount of a chemical called sulphorphane that has anti-cancer compound. Researchers found that raw broccoli lacks sulpharpane and has no cancer fighting power, but when broccoli is heated to 60 C it contains the anti-cancer compound at higher ratio. This is a very difficult way obtain sulphoraphane, because you have to be careful not to cook it. Researchers suggest ways to insure high levels of sulphoraphane by eliminating genes, and hybrids with wild strains. All this sounds scary when they are changing the chemical structure of the vegetable. There are always other vegetables and fruits that are rich in other chemicals that help fight cancer and other health ailments.
