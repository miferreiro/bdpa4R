When you enter a local marketplace what is the first thing you see when you walk in? Chips? Candy? Cookies? How often do you see the fruits and vegetables, "out of stock" or "sold out," hardly ever. Often times we go for the junk food first before even touching the healthy food because junk food is cheaper and more convenient for local food shoppers. Why is it that we are so quick to buy the unhealthy food and yet hesitate to buy the food that are good for us? Many times we buy convenience food because it's more affordable, but then we complain that it makes us gain weight to an extent that we fall into the obese category. If you think about it where does the root of food production begin, and why are some food cheaper than others if they all come from the same place earth. Is the FDA doing enough to protect our bodies from being exposed to chemicals and harms that shouldn't be consumed?

To begin with, the most widely spread crop in the United States is corn crop. In the article, " When a Crop Becomes King," Michael Pollan briefly elaborates on how taxpayers pay farmers billions in dollars towards investments in corn crops. Over the past years our food supply has undergone "cornification" in the food production process. Corn is also known as an "invisible" ingredient because it's in majority of ingredients and anything we consume. Our farmers are producing mass amounts of corn that often times leads to overproduction; however, they use that corn to feed farm animals to add to their mass food production.
