Food ingredients have been used for many years to preserve, give flavor to our food, add color and tone our meals. It has played an important role in reducing nutritional deficiencies among consumers. Food and color additives are  carefully handled and regulated in order to assure consumers a safe amount is added to their food. Furthermore, all food manufacturers are accountable for following all safety measures and procedures; scientific understanding and methods of testing new mixtures continue to improve. In the article  "Overview of Food Ingredients, Additives & Colors," it points out how "Regulations known as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) limit the amount of food ingredients used in food to the amount necessary to achieve the desired effect." This can definitely put consumers at ease knowing that their food won't be handled carelessly and that food industries  have a limit in exactly how much additive they can apply to the food to give it a tasteful effect.
