So what can you learn from her approach to cooking?
Here are seven tips I learned and would like to pass on to you:

Tip 1. As one who wants to write on the broad and niche topics of food, you can write your evaluation of a chef, your thoughts on the latest paleo recipes, meal delivery service reviews, or even your examination of renowned food emporiums. These could project haute cuisine in an elegant style and presentation. This always attracts the attention of gastronomic readers. This writing approach creates an impression of the most popular ingredients, newest restaurant trends, chefs, and recipes.

Tip 2. One obvious skill that you must develop is learning how to write descriptively from what you experience through your five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Combine a dash of light humor with your well-focused food article that clearly defines its purpose. Recreate a signature writing style of your own.

Tip 3. Collectors of recipes often become annoyed when realizing the writer had omitted or reduced the importance of certain ingredients. It's important that if you add a recipe as part of an article or a book that you follow the recipe's steps yourself and determine if it requires additional details or not.

Tip 4. When you decide what food topic you want to write on, plan out an introduction or sidebar that will suggest side dishes or condiments, such as appetizers, garnishes, after dinner wines, and recommended desserts. These can be supported by comments or quotes from top chefs or reputable restaurants. This will give your article greater credibility.

Tip 5. You can learn the value of sharing and exchanging ideas about food ingredients and cooking styles from watching any episode of Child's cooking show. A food article that provides different viewpoints and shares techniques from other chefs will greatly interest readers. Plus, writing specifically to the tastes and interests of your readers will build a loyal following.

Tip 6. Each food article could project culinary content in a progressive manner. As Child did with her TV audience, you, too, should welcome novice foodies into your readership of experienced gastronomes.

Tip 7. Child respected other culinary styles and approached her cooking with humility. You may find writing styles of professional food writers essential to your progress. This doesn't mean copying or emulating other writing styles. It simply means that you can improve your own writing talents by learning proven writing methods used by seasoned food writers, especially methods that are different from your own.
