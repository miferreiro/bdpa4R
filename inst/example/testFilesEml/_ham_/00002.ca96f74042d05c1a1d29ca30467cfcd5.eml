In the article, "The Pleasures of Eating," by Wendell Berry, he talks about industrial food consumers and how we should be more active in our eating. "The specialization of production induces specialization of consumption." (Berry 5). Berry points out that we are passive, uncritical and dependent on food industrialization, but our unconsciousness of what we put in our mouth puts our health at risk. The big issue is food processing extent and purpose of how, and what is happening to our food more importantly to us a a result of the processing. When our food are processed they are regulated into three categories unprocessed, processed culinary, and ultra-processed. Unprocessed food that are made by a person with reasonable cooking skill in a kitchen with whole-food ingredients that don't change the nutritional value of it. Processed culinary ingredients are usually food found in the center aisles at grocery stores and are more likely to contain ingredients that you wouldn't have in your kitchen; however, I would recommend sticking to unprocessed food, that are more organic and nutritious. Processed food have long ingredient lists that include different types of vegetable oils, such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, canola oil or safflower oil.  The last category is Ultra products that combine processed and unprocessed ingredients like sugar and sweets.
