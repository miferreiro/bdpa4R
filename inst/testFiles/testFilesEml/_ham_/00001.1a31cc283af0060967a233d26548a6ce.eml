Life today is not like how it was before. Along time ago, people ate food that are very good for their health. They ate food that do not contain chemicals, preservatives, artificial colors, and artificial flavors. People also had a lot of time to cook their own food. Therefore those people were not been affected by the food that they ate, because all of the food that they had were natural food and healthy. That's way they did not have any problem on their health and they lived longer than now. But these days, every one is busy and don't have time to cook their own food. People eat food that are easily cooked or ready cooked. They do not even think of what they eat, and if it can effect their health or not. That is a bad way that most people do because our health depends on what we eat daily. food are the building blocks of every cell in the body, are responsible for the proper functioning of the whole body. It is important, for that reason, to know what is good for our body and what is not. food can be classified into two types, unhealthy (junk) and healthy food.
Some people do not have time to cook what they want to eat or they don't want to spend a lot of time cooking. Therefore, they eat food that contain little or no nutrients a part of energy. Those food are called junk food. There are some advantages and disadvantages of eating junk food. The advantages of eating junk food are that they save time. For example, it doesn't take hours to prepare. They can also be cooked easily. The other advantage of unhealthy food is that it is tasty and delicious to eat. Junk food also doesn't cost a lot of money to buy it. For example, in some restaurant, people can buy French fries, sandwiches, and drinks at a cheaper price. The disadvantages of eating unhealthy food that may cause a lot of trouble to our health is that it contain a lot of sugar and salt.
