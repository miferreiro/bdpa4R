Description: 
        Provide a tool to easily build customized data flows to pre-process large volumes 
    of information from different sources. To this end, 'bdpar' allows to (i) easily use and 
    create new functionalities and (ii) develop new data source extractors according to the 
    user needs. Additionally, the package provides by default a predefined data flow 
    to extract and pre-process the most relevant information (tokens, dates, ... ) from some textual 
    sources (SMS, Email, tweets, YouTube comments).
